# Stage 1 Benchmarks

[中文版本](./stage1_zh.md)

This document records the Stage 1 benchmark results for the mini LLM serving system.

Stage 1 scope:

- unary request path
- FIFO queue
- dynamic batching
- Go control plane + Python mock executor
- Prometheus metrics + AdminService runtime stats

## Setup

Workload:

- client: `cmd/bench`
- backend executor: Python mock executor over Connect RPC
- mock execution latency: about `138ms` per request
- target server: Go inference service on `:8800`
- admin/metrics server: `:8801`

Scenarios:

- `baseline_no_batching`
- `dynamic_default`
- `dynamic_fastflush`

Primary metrics:

- client-side: throughput, avg/p50/p90/p99 latency
- server-side: batches total, average batch size, average queue wait, average execution time

## Fixed Scenario Comparison

These runs compare the three Stage 1 modes directly.

|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|

## Dynamic Fastflush Concurrency Sweep

| Concurrency | Requests | Success | Throughput (req/s) | Avg Latency | P50 | P90 | P99 | Avg Batch Size | Avg Queue Wait (s) | Avg Execution (s) |

## Key Findings

### 1. Dynamic batching clearly improves throughput

Compared with `baseline_no_batching`, both dynamic batching modes deliver much higher throughput.

- `baseline_no_batching`: `10.26 req/s`
- `dynamic_default`: `67.22 req/s`
- `dynamic_fastflush`: `71.06 req/s`

Under the current mock workload, dynamic batching improves throughput by roughly `6.5x` to `7x` over the no-batching baseline.

### 2. Backend execution is stable; scheduling is the main differentiator

Across all scenarios, average execution time remains close to `0.138s`.

This indicates that performance differences are primarily caused by request scheduling and batching policy rather than backend instability.

### 3. Higher concurrency increases throughput and batch quality

For both dynamic modes:

- throughput rises as concurrency increases
- average batch size rises with concurrency
- queue wait also rises with concurrency

This is expected behavior for a batching-based serving system: more concurrent requests make it easier to form larger batches, but queueing delay grows as a tradeoff.

### 4. `dynamic_default` vs `dynamic_fastflush`

Under this workload:

- at low concurrency, `dynamic_default` performs better than `dynamic_fastflush`
- at higher concurrency, both scale well
- `dynamic_fastflush` reaches slightly higher top-end throughput at `concurrency=200`
- `dynamic_default` forms larger batches more consistently

This suggests that the better batching policy depends on request arrival rate:

- lower concurrency benefits from waiting a bit longer to form batches
- higher concurrency benefits from faster flush and lower waiting overhead

## Stage 1 Summary

Stage 1 demonstrates that the system already has the core serving behaviors expected from a minimal LLM serving runtime:

- request queueing
- dynamic batching
- backend executor routing
- end-to-end latency instrumentation
- benchmarkable performance tradeoffs
